Quite cold, very isolated, dusty not good for allergics or species requiring oxygen
However if one would have a space base and suit, it may allow life 
Furthermore, species that need atmospheres would need to be kept inside a pressurized suit or base
Maybe we will not live here one day. It is to difficult :(
